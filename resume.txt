2018 - 2020 | Co-Founder, Ofte, USA
Ofte is a patented, FIDO2-compliant, hardware-based authentication platform that implements continuous authentication. It's designed to be easy for people to use, and easy for developers to integrate into existing applications.
The continuous authentication aspect of the platform provides a number of advantages over many other MFA solutions [golang, FIDO, postgres]

We created the Ofte Platform so that web application developers and the people who use those apps can be very well protected from evil-doers, with an absolute minimum amount of hair-pulling.
Parts of the Ofte tech stack were open-sourced: https://github.com/ofte-auth/

2017 - 2019 | Consulting Backend Engineer - Golang, Rampart Cryptocurrency Exchange
Part of a global, remote team building a secure and scalable cryptocurrency exchange. Wearing many hats but focused on security and exchange mechanics [golang, MFA/2FA, FIDO, U2F, TOTP. Bitcoin, Ethereum, exchange mechanics. Microservices, REST, grpc, etcd, NATS, Redis]

2014 - 2017 | Founder, Programmer, NimbleIndustry.com, Greater Boston Area
Open source technology bridged the gap between industrial equipment and the Industrial Internet (IIoT). NimbleIndustry solved the problem of overly complex IIoT integrations by letting machines roll out of factories ready to emit data compatible with standard IIoT protocols.

2011 - 2013 | Director of Engineering, Brand Solutions and Sprout Platform, InMobi, Remote
As the Director of Engineering, Brand Solutions and Sprout Platform at InMobi, I led the expanded and globally distributed "InMobi Studio" team. We successfully integrated our technology into the InMobi infrastructure and contributed many best practices into InMobi's engineering DNA.
But most importantly, I led a highly functional, distributed engineering team that produced a best-in-class, cloud-based platform that allowed designers to create award-winning content.

2008 - 2010 | VP Engineering, Sprout, Remote
I led the engineering team at Sprout. Having co-authored the original Sprout platform, I primarily dwelled in the core inner-workings of the platform, focusing on issues such as Sprout’s XML representation and geometric models and algorithms for animations. I also performed much of the research work that the Sprout engineering department undertook. My efforts in this aspect of my responsibilities led to numerous advancements in the company's offerings, including the HTML5/mobile generation of ad content.
I also led the metrics efforts for the platform and managed technical relationships with partners such as Google, DoubleClick and Adobe. But most importantly, I led a highly functional, distributed engineering team that produced a best-in-class, cloud-based platform that allowed designers to create award-winning content.

1995 - 2007 | Consultant, The Boston Bit Co, Boston & Remote
* Contractor for Microsoft, I created a realtime Flash Actionscript environment for the presentation of XPLANE artwork in an animated pseudo 3D environment. [Actionscript 2.0, OOD, XML, XSD]
* Consultant for OpenBook Systems, I updated and maintained various features of Grangers, a large-scale searchable online database of poetry. [Java, J2EE, Struts, mysql, JDBC, servlets, XML, Lucene, Castor]
* Consultant for British Petroleum (contract through XPLANE), I created interactive visual learning applications using object-oriented Actionscript and XML. [Actionscript 2.0, OOD, XML, XSD]
* Interim CTO/Architect for Newfields Network, I designed and built the flyingOX web service — a web service for the management and scheduling of events and resources. This service was designed within the J2EE architecture. I conceived and developed distributed scheduling algorithms based on the Contract Net Protocol. I created XML schemas for common scheduling objects. I created comprehensive unit test programs. [Java, J2EE, Postgresql, AXIS, Resin, C++, Actionscript, SOAP, XML, XML Schema, .NET, C#, UML]
* Consultant for Wiznet (wiznet.com), I created an XML-based (J2EE) management application and made improvements in their existing J2EE architecture including the welcomed elimination and replacement of an unwieldy hierarchy construct with a very efficient one. [Java, J2EE, Oracle, XML, XML Schema, UML]

1998 - 2000 | Interim Head of Engineering, Syncra Software, Boston & Remote
For Syncra Software ERP (acquired by Oracle), I led a four person development team, my duties included coordinating development efforts, providing architectural direction, managing new versions and releases, working with support to resolve customer matters, developing and managing project plans. I led the technical efforts in preparing Syncra’s assets for acquisition, including preparing technical documents and presenting the architecture and team members to potential acquirers.
